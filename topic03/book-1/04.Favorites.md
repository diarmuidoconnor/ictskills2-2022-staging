## Tagging favourite movies.

On the Home page, we can tag a movie as one of our favourites by clicking its 'Favourite' icon. This tagging will cause the related card to show a red Favorite Icon on the title bar. As a temporary solution, we will record a tagging by adding a 'favourite' property to the movie object and set it to true. [A more realistically approach is to persist them to a database via an API.] 

![][favorites]

We will again use the inverse data flow (Data down, Action up) pattern in the design of a solution for this feature. In `pages/homePage.js`, make the following changes:
~~~
..... code as before ......

const MovieListPage = (props) => {
  ..... code as before .......

  // New function
  const addToFavourites = (movieId) => {
    const updatedMovies = movies.map((m) =>
      m.id === movieId ? { ...m, favourite: true } : m
    );
    setMovies(updatedMovies);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    ..... code as before .....
  }
  return (
    ...... code as before .....
~~~
Also, replace the line:
~~~
   <MovieList movies={displayedMovies} />
~~~
with the following:
~~~
    <MovieList movies={displayedMovies} selectFavourite={addToFavourites} />
~~~
In `components/movieList/indes.js`, replace the line:
~~~
    <Movie key={m.id} movie={m} />
~~~
with the following:
~~~
    <Movie key={m.id} movie={m} selectFavourite={props.selectFavourite} />
~~~
In `components/movieCard/index.js`, make the following changes:

+ add an event handler:
~~~
export default function MovieCard(props) {
  ..... code as before .......

  const handleAddToFavourite = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    props.selectFavourite(movie.id);
  };

  return (
    ...... code as before .....
~~~
+ replace the lines:
~~~
    <IconButton aria-label="add to favourites" onClick={null}>
      <FavoriteIcon color="primary" fontSize="large" />
    </IconButton>
~~~
with the following:
~~~
    <IconButton aria-label="add to favourites" onClick={handleAddToFavourite}>
        <FavoriteIcon color="primary" fontSize="large" />
    </IconButton>
~~~
+ add an import at the top:
~~~
import Avatar from "@material-ui/core/Avatar";
~~~
+ and replace the line:
~~~
    <CardHeader className={classes.header} title={movie.title} />
~~~
with the following:
~~~
    <CardHeader
      className={classes.header}
      avatar={
        movie.favourite ? (
          <Avatar className={classes.avatar}>
            <FavoriteIcon />
          </Avatar>
        ) : null
      }
      title={
        <Typography variant="h5" component="p">
          {movie.title}{" "}
        </Typography>
      }
    />
~~~
Until now, a component prop is either a data object or a callback functions. However, in the last excerpt above, a component is assigned to the title and avatar props. This is acceptable because a component transpiles to a function. Later we will develop custom components that accept other components as props.

The above changes cause the following runtime execution flow:
1. On the Home page, the user clicks a movie card's Favourite icon.
1. The click event handler invokes the callback provided by the HomePage. 
1. The callback sets the movie's favourite property to true - a state change. 
1. The state change causes the HomePage to re-render. 
1. Each of the MovieCard components re-render, and the tagged MovieCard now displays a (red) Favourite icon in its title.   

Try selecting some movies as your favourites.

We need a new view to display the list of favourites, and its layout can be identical to the home page. Implementing this without violating the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) will require some refactoring - see next section. As a placeholder, create the file `src/pages/favouriteMoviesPage.js` and add this code:
~~~
import React from "react";

const FavouriteMoviesPage = () => {
    return <h2>Favourite Movies</h2>
}

export default FavouriteMoviesPage
~~~
We must update the routing configuration and also add a simple site navigation bar. In `src/index.js`, completely replace the content with the following:
~~~
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Navigate, Routes, Link } from "react-router-dom";
import HomePage from "./pages/homePage";
import MoviePage from "./pages/movieDetailsPage";
import FavouriteMoviesPage from "./pages/favouriteMoviesPage"; // NEW

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/movies/favourites">Favourites</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/movies/favourites" element={<FavouriteMoviesPage/>}
        />
        <Route path="/movies/:id" element={<MoviePage/>} />
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/" replace />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
 ~~~
The app now has some convenient navigation links at the top:

![][navigation]

In the browser, check the new navigation links at the top are working.

The app has a bug! To prove it, try the following sequence:

1. Go to the home page.
1. Click the 'Favourites' icon of the first three movies.
1. Notice, the selected movies are tagged, as expected. 
1. Use the navigation link on top to go to the Favourites page. 
1. Navigate back to the Home page, againg using the navigation link. 
1. The three selected movies are no longer tagged. This reset happened because the useEffect hook queries the API every time the home page component is mounted, i.e. we overwrite the tagged movies information. We will fix this issue in the next lab - I promise!
