# Developing a Movies Fan App.

In this lab, we commence the development of a SPA for Movie enthusiasts. The product will go through several iterations over the coming weeks, adding new functionality and refactoring existing code during that period. The app's data source will be the open web API [The Movie DataBase][tmdb].

## App overview.

The features of the React app will include:

- Display a list of current movie releases. For each one, show its poster image, title, release date and viewer rating.
- Display more detailed information on a movie from the above list by clicking its 'More Info ..' button. The details include plot, genres, runtime, revenue, etc.
- Show extracts from written reviews for a movie.
- Show the full review text for a review.
- Add movies to your favourites list.
- Write a review for one of your favourites.

The views for the app will look as follows:

> > Discover page - List the first 20 movies returned by the TMDB API:

![][home]

> > The list of movies can be filtered by genre, title, or both:

![][filtering]

> > The Movie Details page will look as follows:

![][details]

> > The Details page can optionally show extracts from all reviews written for the movie:

![][extracts]

> > The above review extracts are clickable to give the full review text (The Review page):

![][review]

> > The Favorites page - Lists the user's favourite movies, as selected from the Home page list:

![][favorites]

> > The User can write a review for any of their favourite movies:

![][form]

The TMDB (The Movie Database) API has a rich data model. At its core is the Movie entity. A sample instance of this entity is listed below - study its structure.
