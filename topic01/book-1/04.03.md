## Exercise 3 (Props).

The next improvement is to make it the component __reusable__ by passing the model data in as __props__. The props will be:

+ An array of (still only two) modules and
+ The course name. 

The file `src/stories/exercises/03-component.stories.js` contains the story for this exercise - note the names it uses for the props, i.e. course and modules.Implement your component solution in `src/components/exercises/03_props.js`. Copy your solution code for exercise 2 as the starting point and also refer to `components/samples/03_props.js` as a guide for the changes required.

In the browser, click 'Exercises -> 03 component with props' to see your component render.

On completing the exercise, stop the server and type these commands in the terminal:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 3 completed."
~~~
Restart the server.
