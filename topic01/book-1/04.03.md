## Exercise 3 (Props).

A further design improvement to our component is to make it __reusable__ by passing the data in as __props__.

The story for this exercise is implemented in `stories/exercises/03-component..stories.js`.

Implement your solution in `components/exercises/03_props.js`. Use the code from exercise 2 as the starting point and reference `components/samples/03_props.js` as a guide to the changes required. Note your component must use the same prop names as the story, i.e. course and modules.

Click 'Exercises -> 03 component with props' in the Storybook UI to see your solution render.

On completing the exercise, stop the server and type these commands in the terminal:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 3 completed."
~~~
Restart the Storybook server.
