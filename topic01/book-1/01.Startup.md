## Startup.

Download and unzip [this archive][code] and import it into VS Code - drag and drop.

![][vscode] 

Open an integrated terminal in the editor:

![][terminal] 

and type the command:
~~~
$ npm install
~~~

This command installs the JS modules needed (e.g. React and its dependencies) in a local folder, called `node_modules`.

![][install] 

This lab contains the following top-level folder structure:
~~~
     basicReactLab
       |
       |---.storybook
       |---src
            |---components
                  |
                  |---exercises
                  |---samples
            |
            |---stories
                  |
                  |---exercises
                  |---samples          
~~~
Your focus will be on the two sub-folders of `src/components`. There are completed sample components in `src/components/samples`, which were discussed in the lecture. The `src/components/exercises` folder has skeleton implementations of the components you will develop during this lab. In the VS Code integrated terminal, type:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~
This command is shorthand for:

>npx start-storybook -p 6006

It runs the binary executable `./node_modules/.bin/start-storybook`. The 'start-storybook' executable transpiles all our ES6 and JSX code, starts the storybook web server on port 6006, opens a web browser tab and navigates to http://localhost:6006:

![][storybook] 

### The sample components.

Each file in the `src/components/samples` folder contains a component implementation. The file names are prefixed with a sequence number (01_, 02_ etc.) to help relate them to the story name in the Storybook UI side panel (see above screenshot). For example, the component relate to the story 'Samples -> 03-component with props' is implemented in `src/components/samples/03_props.js`.

![][numbers] 

[ It is conventional for a component file name to match the component name it exports. This practice is not applied here, and the numbering system was used instead.]

The Storybook server provides live reloading, i.e. you can see the effect of code changes immediately. For example, in the browser, click the `01 - static component` sample, open the file `src/components/samples/01_staticComponent.js` in VS Code, and change the list of languages to the following:
~~~
<ul>
   <li>Erlang</li>
   <li>Clojure</li>
</ul>  
~~~
Save the change and notice that the browser was automatically updated.

### The exercises components.

Click on any of the exercise stories in the Storybook UI side panel;

![][exercises] 

They are incomplete. 

Leave the Storybook server running while completing this lab's exercises. If you do need to stop it, hit 'cntl/c'. To restart it, type:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~
