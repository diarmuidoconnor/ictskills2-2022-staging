## Exercise 2 (Embedded variables).

In exercise 1 the course data was hard-coded in the JSX - course name, module details. A slight improvement would be to place the data in local variables and reference them from the JSX code. __You are required__ to implement this improvement.

For convenience, we will implement the component in a separate file = `components/exercises/02_embeddedVars.js`. The story for this exercise is already provided - see `src/stories/exercises/02-component.stories.js`.

The steps to complete this exercise are as follows:
 
+ __Step 1__: In the Storybook UI in the browser, click the link: 'Samples -> 02 - JSX embedded variables'. Examine the related component code in `components/samples/02_embeddedVariables.js`.
+ __Step 2__: Copy the code from `components/exercises/01_staticComponent.js` to  `components/exercises/02_embeddedVars.js`.
+ __Step 3__: Modify the copied code to use embedded variables for its data, e.g. a two-element array for the modules. See the hint below.
+ __Step 4__: In the browser, click the link: 'Exercises -> 02 - JSX embedded variables' to see the result of your implementation. 

Hint: The JSX excerpt below is a guide to the solution required:
~~~ 
  . . . . . . 
<tr>
  <td>{modules[1].name}</td>
  <td>modules[1].noLectures}</td>
  <td>{modules[1].noPracticals}</td>
</tr>
  . . . . . . . 
~~~

[If necessary, see 'Exercise 2 solution' in the last section of the lab.]

On completing the exercise, stop the server and type these commands in the terminal:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 2 completed"
~~~
Restart the server.
