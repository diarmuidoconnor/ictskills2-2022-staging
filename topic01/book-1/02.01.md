## Exercise 1 (Static Component).

__You are required__ to implement a static React component that renders a view similar to that illustrated below (You may wish to substitute your course title and module names in the solution):

![][exercise1]

For now, assume the list has __exactly two modules__ - we will make it more adaptable later. You must implement the solution in the file `src/components/exercises/01_staticComponent.js`. The story for this component is already implemented - see `src/stories/exercises/01-component.stories.js`.

As a guide, the raw HTML table syntax to produce the list of modules above is as follows:
~~~
<table className="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>No lectures</th>
      <th>No practicals</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody >
    <tr>
      <td>DevOps</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Enterprise Web Dev</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody >
</table>
~~~
[The CSS classes used above are from the Bootstrap library. It is not necessary to be familiar with it as we will not be used it in subsequent labs.]

The steps to completing this exercise are:

+ __Step 1__: In the side panel of the Storybook UI (in the browser), click the story 'Samples -> 01 - static component'. Then examine its related component code in `src/components/samples/01_staticComponent.js`. Use it as a guide for your solution.
+ __Step 2__: In the Storybook UI, click the story 'Exercises -> 01 - static component' and open the related component file `src/components/exercises/01_staticComponent.js`. Change the component's return statement to produce the table of module. [Do not change the component function name.] 

As you work through a solution, keep checking how the component is rendering in the Storybook UI - live-reloading happens every time you save the changes to the component file. 

If necessary, you may wish to consult the 'Solutions' in the last section of this lab.

On completion, in the VS Code integrated terminal panel, stop the Storybook server and update the local Git repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 1 completed."
~~~
Restart the Storybook server:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~
