## Exercise 4 (Iteration).
 
In the previous exercise, the component was hard-coded to expect a modules array prop of exactly two elements. Now make it flexible enough to handle any array size. __You are required__ to implement your solution in `src/components/exercises/04_iteration.js`. Use `components/samples/04_iteration.js` as a guide.

The file `src/stories/exercises/04-component.stories.js` contains a story for this exercise.

In the Storybook UI, click 'Exercises -> 04 - iteration' to confirm your solution. It should resemble the following:

If necessary, see the Solutions section for an outline solution.

On completing the exercise, update the local repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise 4 completed."
~~~
That completes this lab.
