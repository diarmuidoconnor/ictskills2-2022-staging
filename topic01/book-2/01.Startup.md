## Startup.

For convenience, we will use the 'course modules' context again in this lab. 

Create a new empty folder (away from `basicReactLab`). Open an ordinary operating system terminal/shell window, go to your new folder and type the commands:
~~~
$ npx create-react-app course-app
~~~
The command **scaffolds** a React project in a new folder called `course-app`. Its content is similar to that illustrated below:

![][scaffold]

Now load the `course-app` folder into VS Code. As we are using React v17, in the app's `package.json` file, replace the dependencies section with the following:
~~~
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.1",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.1",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.0"
  },
~~~
Delete the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file. Open an integrated terminal in VS Code, and reinstall the dependencies:
~~~
$ npm install
~~~

In `src/index.js`, replace the entire content with the following:
~~~
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App/>,document.getElementById('root'));
~~~
The above update is due to breaking changes between versions 17 and 18 of the React framework, specifically the react-dom module.

CRA creates a runnable app from the outset. To prove it, in VS Code's integrated terminal, type the command:
~~~
$ npm start
~~~
This command performs the following task sequence:

- Transpiles any JSX and ES6 code in the `src` folder, starting with `src/index.js` and then follows the import statements to find other dependencies. Note, you will not see physical evidence of the transpiled files on the filesystem.
- Starts a **development-mode web server** on port 3000.
- Opens a tab in your default web browser and issue an HTTP request to http://localhost:3000/
- The server responds with `public/index.html`, followed by relevant assets (transpiled JS, CSS etc.).

The server performs **live reloading** - watches all project source files for updates, re-transpiles them when required, and hot-reloads them in the browser.

The browser should now be displaying the default React app:

![][default]

We will mould this skeleton app into a simple custom app. The desired user interface we want to achieve is similar to the following (Substitute the course name and module names accordingly):

![][obj]

The app's component hierarchy will be as follows:
~~~
       App 
        |
        |
        V
      Course
        |
        |  
        V
      Module
~~~
The App component renders a child called Course. Course renders many instances of a Module component.
