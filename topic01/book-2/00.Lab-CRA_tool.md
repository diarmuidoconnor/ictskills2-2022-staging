# Create React App tool.

This lab introduces the create-react-app (CRA) tool. While Storybook is a tool for developing individual components, CRA creates a complete application (app).

------------------------------------

__React 18__ - The React team released Version 18 of the framework in March 2022. The new features it provides are not relevant to this module, and we will be using version 17 instead. The CRA tool installs version 18 by default; however, it will not impact this lab exercise.
