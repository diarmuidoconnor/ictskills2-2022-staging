## Building a production app.

The development server environment is unsuitable for a public-facing or production app. Transpilation should not happen dynamically, and all file sizes should be **minified**, thus improving load-time performance. To build a production-ready app, stop the development server and type the command:
~~~
$ npm run build
~~~
This command creates a `build` folder for the production-quality, static form of the app:

![][build]

The name of the file containing your code (and the React runtime code) is a computed hash value of its content, e.g. `main.hash-value.js`. This naming strategy aids the browser's caching support. Notice also the code is in minified form to reduce network transport time.

We can use VS Code's Live Server extension to demo the production version of the app. Open a new window in VS Code:

![][window]

Drag-and-drop the project's `build` folder to the new VS Code window. Start the  Live server by clicking the 'Go Live' link in the editor's status bar. The browser should be rendering your app.

Notice, the project's `.gitignore` file (generated by CRA) includes the `/build` folder - we never commit generated files/folders to a repository.
