## Bug Fix.

Currently, the favourite movies page has a bug: the movies listed on the page have a 'Add to Favourites' icon, which is illogical. We will replace it with two options:

- Remove from favourites.
- Write a review of the movie.

![][favcard]

We want a movie card's icons (and their roles) to be conditional on the page that uses them. To meet this requirement, we must refactor the existing code. The _Render props_ pattern ([read more][renderprop]) will provide the design for the refactoring.

> > "A component with a render prop uses it to produce a React element  instead of implementing the rendering logic itself."

In our case, the render prop function will return the appropriate type of icon(s).

Recall, in `contexts/moviesContext.js`, we already added a function for removing favourites. Create the folder `src/components/cardIcons` and in it create three files:

- `addToFavourites.js`, with the following code:

```
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import { MoviesContext } from "../../contexts/moviesContext";
import IconButton from "@material-ui/core/IconButton";
import FavoriteIcon from "@material-ui/icons/Favorite";

const AddToFavouritesIcon = ({ movie }) => {
  const context = useContext(MoviesContext);

  const handleAddToFavourites = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    context.addToFavourites(movie);
  };
  return (
    <IconButton aria-label="add to favorites" onClick={handleAddToFavourites}>
      <FavoriteIcon color="primary" fontSize="large" />
    </IconButton>
  );
};

export default AddToFavouritesIcon;
```

- `writeReview.js` (it's only a placeholder for now):

```
import React from "react";
import RateReviewIcon from "@material-ui/icons/RateReview";

const WriteReviewIcon = ({ movie }) => {
  return (
    <RateReviewIcon color="primary" fontSize="large" />
  );
};

export default  WriteReviewIcon;
```

- and `removeFromFavourites.js`:

```
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import IconButton from "@material-ui/core/IconButton";
import DeleteIcon from "@material-ui/icons/Delete";
import { MoviesContext } from "../../contexts/moviesContext";

const RemoveFromFavouritesIcon = ({ movie }) => {
  const context = useContext(MoviesContext);

  const handleRemoveFromFavourites = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    context.removeFromFavourites(movie);
  };
  return (
    <IconButton
      aria-label="remove from favorites"
      onClick={handleRemoveFromFavourites}
    >
      <DeleteIcon color="primary" fontSize="large" />
    </IconButton>
  );
};

export default RemoveFromFavouritesIcon;
```
In `pages/homePage.js`, make the following changes:

```
..... other imports ......
import AddToFavouritesIcon from '../components/cardIcons/addToFavourites'

const HomePage = (props) => {
   ..... as before ......
   return (
      <PageTemplate
        title="Discover Movies"
        movies={movies}
        action={(movie) => {
          return <AddToFavouritesIcon movie={movie} />
        }}
      />
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```
The render prop in the above code appears in the lines:
```
    action={(movie) => {
      return <AddToFavouritesButton movie={movie} />
    }}
```
The render prop's function returns the icon to display in movie cards on the home page. We must pass the render prop down the component hierarchy to the movie card component, which ultimately will invoke it. In `components/templateMovieListPage/index.js`:

- change the props destructuring in the component declaration line, as follows:

```
function MovieListPageTemplate({ movies, title, action }) {
```

- change the return statement, as outlined here:

```
return (
    <Grid container className={classes.root}>
      .......
        <MovieList action={action} movies={displayedMovies}></MovieList>
      .......
    </Grid>
);
```
In `components/movieList/index.js`, completely replace the code with:

```
import React from "react";
import Movie from "../movieCard";
import Grid from "@material-ui/core/Grid";

const MovieList = ( {movies, action }) => {
  let movieCards = movies.map((m) => (
    <Grid key={m.id} item xs={12} sm={6} md={4} lg={3} xl={2}>
      <Movie key={m.id} movie={m} action={action} />
    </Grid>
  ));
  return movieCards;
};

export default MovieList;
```
In `components/movieCard/index.js`, update the component code as follows:

```
..... other code .....
export default function MovieCard({ movie, action }) {
  ..... as before ....
  return (
    <Card className={classes.card}>
      ...........
      <CardActions disableSpacing>
        {action(movie)}
        <Link to={`/movies/${movie.id}`}>
           .......
      </CardActions>
    </Card>
  );
}
```
In the above code, we replaced the hard-coded Favorite icon and its associated click event handler with the render prop function call, i.e.

```
    {action(movie)}
```
There are a few 'unused variable` warning messages resulting from the transpilation of the codebase. You can fix these by simply removing them.

The add to favourites feature is now working on the Home page; however, the Favourites page is broken (again!). To fix it, in `pages/favouriteMoviesPage.js`, update the code, as follows:

```
.... other imports ....
import RemoveFromFavourites from "../components/cardIcons/removeFromFavourites";
import WriteReview from "../components/cardIcons/writeReview";

const FavouriteMoviesPage = () => {
  ..... as before .....
  return (
    <PageTemplate
      title="Favourite Movies"
      movies={movies}
      action={(movie) => {
        return (
          <>
            <RemoveFromFavourites movie={movie} />
            <WriteReview movie={movie} />
          </>
        );
      }}
    />
  );
};

export default FavouriteMoviesPage;
```
The main change made above was introducing the render prop, i.e.

```
      action={(movie) => {
        return (
          <>
            <RemoveFromFavourites movie={movie} />
            <WriteReview movie={movie} />
          </>
        );
      }}
```
[Clean up the code by remove any unused variable identified by the transpiler.]

The above code causes movie cards on the Favourite movies page to have two action icons: Remove from the Favourites and Write a Review. In the browser, tag some movies as favourites, navigaye to the Favourites page and try clicking the trash icon to remove one of them. 

Update the git repository as follows:

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Bug Fix - make action icons on movie card configurable."
$ git push origin main
