## Global Data and Contexts.

A common feature of React apps is where many components need to access the same piece of data. For example, many components may need to know the identity of the currently authenticated user. However, this situation can lead to 'prop drilling', where components in the middle of the component hierarchy must pass props from a high-level component to low-level components - the middle-tier components may not use the props themselves. React provides __Contexts__ to solve this problem - it is an implementation of the generic Provider design pattern. We will use a Context to store information about movies tagged as favourites. The Home page and Favourites page will use the Context as both use this data.

Create the file `src/contexts/moviesContext.jsx` and add this code:

```
import React, { useState } from "react";

export const MoviesContext = React.createContext(null);

const MoviesContextProvider = (props) => {
  const [favourites, setFavourites] = useState([]);

  const addToFavourites = (movie) => {
    let updatedFavourites = [...favourites];
    if (!favourites.includes(movie.id)) {
      updatedFavourites.push(movie.id);
    }
    setFavourites(updatedFavourites);
  };

  // We will use this function in a later section
  const removeFromFavourites = (movie) => {
    setFavourites(favourites.filter((mId) => mId !== movie.id));
  };

  return (
    <MoviesContext.Provider
      value={{
        favourites,
        addToFavourites,
        removeFromFavourites,
      }}
    >
      {props.children}
    </MoviesContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default MoviesContextProvider;
```
Note, we are storing only the selected movie's id in the favourites array above. 

The MoviesContextProvider component is not exceptional - it simply manages the list of favourites. However, the intention is to compose it with other components using the Container pattern - _props.children_. A distinguishing feature of MoviesContextProvider is it also plays a __context provider__ due to the _MoviesContext.Provider_ wrapper. This role will allow other components it is composed with to access to the context, i.e. access the favourite movies state (and the two functions that manipulate it). The net result is we avoid prop drilling.

In `src/index.jsx`, make these changes:

- add an import:

```
import MoviesContextProvider from "./contexts/moviesContext";
```

- modify the App component:

```
const App = () => {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <SiteHeader />
          <MoviesContextProvider>
            <Routes>
               .....code as before .....
            </Routes>
        </MoviesContextProvider>
      </BrowserRouter>
      <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
};
```
The App component _composes_ the MoviesContextProvider with the rest of our components/pages. All components/pages can access the _values_ in the context, subject to a small code addition. For example, the Home page and Favourites page will be able to access the favourites list - previously stored in the browser's local storage. In `components/movieCard/index.jsx`, make these changes:
~~~js
import React, { useContext  } from "react";
..... other imports .....
import { MoviesContext } from "../../contexts/moviesContext";

..... other (styling) code .....

export default function MovieCard({ movie }) {      // Destructure props
  const { favourites, addToFavourites } = useContext(MoviesContext);
  
  if (favourites.find((id) => id === movie.id)) {
    movie.favourite = true;
  } else {
    movie.favourite = false
  }

  const handleAddToFavourite = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    addToFavourites(movie);
  };

  return (
     .... as before ....
  );
}
~~~
The useContext hook allows a component to _consume_ the values exposed by a context provider, e.g. the addToFavorites function and favourites array. 

The Favourite movies page can use the favourite movie ids to fetch the movie details from TMDB - alternatively, we could have excavated the movie details  from the cache, but this is somewhat unorthodox. React-query supports __parallel queries__, which we can utilize here. In `pages/favoriteMoviesPage.jsx`, completely replace the code with the following:
```
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import PageTemplate from "../components/templateMovieListPage";
import { MoviesContext } from "../contexts/moviesContext";
import { useQueries } from "react-query";
import { getMovie } from "../api/tmdb-api";
import Spinner from "../components/spinner";

const FavouriteMoviesPage = (props) => {
  const { favourites: movieIds } = useContext(MoviesContext);

  // Create an array of queries and run them in parallel.
  const favouriteMovieQueries = useQueries(
    movieIds.map((movieId) => {
      return {
        queryKey: ["movie", { id: movieId }],
        queryFn: getMovie,
      };
    })
  );
  // Check if any of the parallel queries is still loading.
  const isLoading = favouriteMovieQueries.find((m) => m.isLoading === true);

  if (isLoading) {
    return <Spinner />;
  }

  const movies = favouriteMovieQueries.map((q) => q.data);

  const toDo = () => true;

  return (
    <PageTemplate
      title="Favourite Movies"
      movies={movies}
      selectFavourite={toDo}
    />
  );
};

export default FavouriteMoviesPage;
```
Note, TMDB returns a different object structure for a movie when asked for a list of movies rather than details of a particular movie. For this reason, the genre filtering condition is different for the Favourites page as opposed to the home page.

In the browser, try the following sequence:

1. Go to the home page.
1. Click the 'Favorites' icon of the first three movies - they now each have a favourite icon coloured red in the title.
1. Navigate to the Favorites page. It's showing the tagged movies.
1. Navigate back to the Home page. The three movies are still tagged as favourites. 

Update the git repository as follows:

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Refactor: Favourite movie list now stored in a context."
$ git push origin main

```
