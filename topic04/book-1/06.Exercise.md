## Exercise.

TMDB has several **endpoints** for requesting data. We have already used four: Discover, Movies, Genres, and Reviews. The Movies endpoint has several query options; for example, 'upcoming' will returns a list of movies that will soon appear in cinemas - see more [here][endpoint]). According to the TMDB documentation, the upcoming movies endpoint URL is:

>> https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/upcoming?api_key=...your-key...&language=en-US&page=1

**You are required** to add a new page to the app which displays a list of upcoming movies. 
The new page's URL should be '/movies/upcoming', and the page's layout should closely mirror that of the home page. The site header should include a navigation link to this page:

![][upcoming]

[Notes:

1. There may be some overlap between the movies TMDB includes in the upcoming list and the discover list (the home page)]
2. A Select Must Watch feature is more appropriate than Select Favourites for upcoming movies, but this can be ignored at this stage. To ensure tha page does not crash if the user tries tagging movies as favourites, declare the event handler in the upcoming movies page as folliws:

~~~
  const addToFavourites = () => null;
~~~

On completing the exercise, update the git repository:

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added Upcoming movies page."
$ git push origin master
```
