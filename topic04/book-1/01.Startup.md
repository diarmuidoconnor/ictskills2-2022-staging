## GitHub setup.

[You may skip this section if you have already created a GitHub repository for this app.]

Go to your Github account and create a new repository called ict2-moviesApp. 

![][github]

In VS Code, assuming the app is already imported, open an integrated terminal and type the commands (Insert your Github username in the URL):
~~~
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/[your github username]/ict2-moviesApp.git
$ git push -u origin master
~~~
In the browser, refresh the page; you should now see the repository contains the app files. You can also check the Git commit history by clicking the hyperlink shown on the screenshot.
