# Developing a Movies Fan App - Part 3.

In this lab, we tackle the third development iteration of the Movies Fan app. We will now implement the following aspects of the feature list mentioned in Part 1 of this series:

+ In the Movie details page, the user can optionally show an excerpt from published critic reviews.
+ Clicking the 'More' link on a review excerpt will display the full review text on a separate page.
+ Have a more professional-looking site header.

We will use two new React coding techniques in the implementation:

+ Component composition patterns.
+ Custom hooks.

Also, we will utilize the Extended Link routing featured.
