# The Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) lets you define cloud infrastructure as code in a range of programming languages - we will use Typescript.

## Prerequisites.

To use the CDK toolkit. your development environment must include the following:

+ The NodeJS runtime platform and the npm package manager installed on your local computer.
+ The Visual Studio code editor installed locally.
+ An AWS account.
+ The AWS CLI installed on your local computer.

## Setup.

Install the AWS CDK Toolkit globally using the following shell command:
~~~bash
$ npm install -g aws-cdk
~~~
[The $ represents the shell prompt; it is not part of the command.]
Run the following command to verify a correct installation:
~~~bash
$ cdk --version
~~~

To deploy stacks using the AWS CDK, your AWS account requires a dedicated S3 buckets and other containers to be available - AWS CloudFormation uses them during deployment. Creating these is called __bootstrapping__. To bootstrap, issue the following shell command:

~~~bash
$ cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION
~~~
wnere ACCOUNT-NUMBER is a 12-digit number that is specific to your AWS account, and REGION must be `eu-west-1`. Use the AWS CLI to discover your account number with the following shell command:
~~~bash
$ aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text
~~~
A sample bootstrapping command might be as follows:

>>$ cdk bootstrap aws://123456789012/eu-west-1


Confirm that this worked by going to the AWS web management console, navigate to the CloudFormation service page and check for the presence of the CDKToolkit stack:

![][boot]

This also creates an S3 bucket to store assets required by the CDK. Do not remove and resources created from bootstrapping.
