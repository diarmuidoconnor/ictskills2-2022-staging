# ALB-EC2 stack

Our objective is to deploy the following application stack to AWS:

![][schema]

The code can be cloned from https://github.com/diarmuidoconnor/cdk-alb-ec2-webAPI

>>$ git clone https://github.com/diarmuidoconnor/cdk-alb-ec2-webAPI

Import the repository into VS Code, open an integrated terminal, and deploy the app:

~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~

Assuming the deployment was successful, the domain name of the newly created Application load balancer resource is printed in the terminal output:

![][alb]

Copy the name and paste it in to a browser tab:

![][root]

This confirms the web API server is running inside the EC2 instance. Im the browser, add `api/movies` to the end of the domain name URL: 

![][api]

The response above confirms the API server is successfully communicating with the MongoDB database. 

In the management console, check the stack deployment in CloudFormation:

![][cf]

## State Management.

In the management console, go to the EC2 console and navigate to the security group declared for the EC2 instance hosting the web API server, It currently has one inbound rule defined:

![][secgrp]

To demonstrate the state management side of the CDK framework (and by implication CloudFormation), in VS Code, open the file `lib/cdk-stack.ts` and uncomment the lines:

~~~js
    serverSG.addIngressRule(
      Peer.anyIpv4(),
      Port.tcp(22),
      'allow SSH access from anywhere',
    );
~~~
This adds a second rule to the security group of the server. Redeploy the app:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~
Type 'y' to confirm the changes that CloudFormation will make to your deployed resources.

When the deployment is complete, recheck the security group in the management console:

![][secgrp2]
