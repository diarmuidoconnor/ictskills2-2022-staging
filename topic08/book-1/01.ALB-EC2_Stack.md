# ALB-EC2 stack

The objective is to deploy the following application stack to AWS:

![][schema]

The EC2 instance is hosting a Web API built on a Node and Express platform. The API communicates with a MongoDB database hosted on a separate service.  The code for this stack can be cloned from [here](https://github.com/diarmuidoconnor/cdk-alb-ec2-webAPI)

>>$ git clone https://github.com/diarmuidoconnor/cdk-alb-ec2-webAPI

Import the `cdk-alb-ec2-webAPI)` folder into VS Code, open an integrated terminal, and deploy the app:

~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~

Assuming the deployment was successful, the domain name of the newly created Application Load Balancer resource is printed in the terminal output:

![][alb]

Copy the name and paste it in to a browser tab:

![][root]

This confirms the web API server is running inside the EC2 instance. Im the browser, add `api/movies` to the end of the domain name URL: 

![][api]

The response above confirms the API server is successfully communicating with the MongoDB database. 

In the management console, check the stack deployment in CloudFormation:

![][cf]

## Infrastructure State Management.

In the management console, go to the EC2 console and navigate to the security group declared for the EC2 instance hosting the web API server - click 'Security Groups' on the left panel and find the group with 'cdk-stack-webserversg' in its name: 

![][secgrp]

It currently has one inbound rule defined. To demonstrate the state management side of the CDK framework (and by implication CloudFormation), in VS Code, open the file `lib/cdk-stack.ts` and uncomment the lines:

~~~js
    serverSG.addIngressRule(
      Peer.anyIpv4(),
      Port.tcp(22),
      'allow SSH access from anywhere',
    );
~~~
This adds a second rule to the security group of the server. Redeploy the app:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~
Type 'y' to confirm the changes that CloudFormation will make to your deployed resources.

When the deployment is complete, recheck the security group in the management console:

![][secgrp2]

## Cleanup

To avoid incurring any cost, destroy the stack with the command:
~~~bash
$ cdk destroy
~~~
