# Assignment specification.

## Overview.

__Objective:__ Demonstrate your knowledge of the React framework and ecosystem by designing and developing a SPA. The app may extend the Movies app developed in the labs (preferred option) or be bespoke (subject to approval).

__Completion__: 7/08/2023.

__Weight__: 60%.

__Deliverables__:
A text file (assignment.txt) containing:
+ The URL of your source code GitHub repo.
     + README - based on provided template. (*1)
     + Git history. (*2)
+ The URL of the YouTube video demonstrating your app.

1. The README is the documentation of the work you have carried out and must be complete and accurate.
1. You must maintain a detailed Git commit history throughout the assignment period. We advise that you commit at least once for every development session. Commit messages must always state the purpose of each session, whether completed or not - the 'only commit working code' principle need not always apply.
